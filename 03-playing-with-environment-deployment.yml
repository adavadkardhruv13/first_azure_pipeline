# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# trigger:
# - main

# strategy:
#  matrix:
#    linux:
#     operatingsystem: 'ubuntu-latest'
#    mac:
#      operatingsystem: 'macos-latest'

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

stages: 
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
    - bash: echo "do the build"  

- stage: DevDeploy
  jobs:
  - deployment: DevDeploymentJob
    environment: Dev
    strategy: 
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - script: echo "deploy to Dev"
          
- stage: QADeploy
  jobs:
  - deployment: QADeploymentJob
    environment: QA
    strategy: 
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - script: echo "deploy to QA"
